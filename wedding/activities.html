  <p>There are many ways to treat yourself to a relaxing spa or massage on Boracay. For the budget traveler, there are many independent women that will walk down the beach and offer massages right on the sand. (300PhP). There are also numerous massage stations on the footpath (350 PhP). There are some hotels that have massage houses on the beach that also offer quality massages.

  <h3>ISLAND HOPPING - CRYSTAL COVE</h3>
  <p>Getting out into the waters around Boracay is a beautiful way to see the island. The Paraw is a simple sailboat that will take you around the island, where you can stop off at many of Boracay's 12 beaches for a swim, snorkel or picnic. Many of these beaches are deserted, some accessible only by boat. Crystal Cove is one of these islands and undoubtedly one of the highlights of an island hopping trip. True to its name, this 2.5 hectare island is blessed with crystal clear waters which you can admire from shore or immerse yourself in a tropical wonderland. You can also swim into two caves which the island has to offer. The 200 pesos entry fee is definitely worth the experience!</p>

  <h3>RIDE THE ZORB!</h3>
  <p>This activity is new in Boracay and all I can say is: Wow! Can you imagine how much fun it is riding down a hill inside a giant ball?</p>
  <p>The Zorb Park is located in Yapak on the way to the Bat Cave. It's fun for all ages and affordable. We rented a tricycle to go there.</p>
  <p>The Park has 2 different rides. The Harness ride is where they strap you in and you roll head over heels. The other ride is the Hydro. They add water inside the ball then you and your friends ride down the hill. Prices range from P300-580 Philippine Pesos per person.</p>

  <h3>ATV ADVENTURE</h3>
  <p>If you're not into water sports or any adventure that has to do with water, then this exciting land adventure, the ATV(All-Terrain Vehicle) ride will bring so much fun in your Bora adventure!</p>
  <p>There are 2 spots to visit, Mt. Luho View Point and the Butterfly Garden.</p>
</div>

<div class="activity">
  <h3>KITE SURFING</h3>
  <p>This sport basically uses a parachute-type kite and 4 lines hooking up the surfer and his surfboard.</p>
  <p>However, it seems like this kite-surfing is a little regulated like scuba-diving so you will need to take a 3 and a half day course which costs about $350. A little on the expensive side but it looks too exciting to pass up.</p>

  <h3>GOLF</h3>
  <p>Playing golf in Boracay makes your trip something different. It makes you feel the opulent and relax feeling of being in a paradise and golfing jewel in one of the world's best beaches.</p>
